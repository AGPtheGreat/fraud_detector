# Fraud Detection Algorithm

### Brief Overview

This project was the final project for my Software Engineering class. It was created in a team of five including me. We used agile methods during the entire project creation.
I was tasked as the project lead. We used HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and CSS for the design and algorithm logic. We also used the database Appwrite.

## About

This project contains code that simulates a banking website. One can login as a User, Bank Manager, and Administrator. When logged in, you can see several different 
transactions, which will have a fraud score associated with it. For each transaction, there will be a background color (green, yellow, or red) which indicates the fraud score
threshold. If a transaction is red, it is fraudulent, green is not fraudulent, and yellow is potential fraud. If a transaction is yellow, the user whose transaction it is can 
manually change the transaction. The user also has several settings which are the main contributor to the fraud score. Some settings include allowing international purchases,
purchases at liquor stores, and daily, weekly, and monthly spending limits. If a transaction occurs in another country when a user restriced international purchases, that 
transaction will be immediately marked as fraud.

## What I Did

We all worked on the settings page, as there was a lot to do, along with the overall design of the website. Me and one of my group members worked on creating and implementing
the database. We also worked on the fraud detection algorithm logic.
